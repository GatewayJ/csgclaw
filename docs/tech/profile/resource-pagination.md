# Agent resource pagination

Agent Profile Skill and MCP lists load cursor batches of 20 through a shared infinite-query hook. An intersection observer uses the Profile scroll region to request the next batch near the bottom, including when the current batch does not fill the viewport. CSS controls the responsive card columns independently of request size. Existing cards remain available during loading; failures offer retry and the final batch shows the total loaded count. Offscreen cards use `content-visibility` to defer browser rendering while retaining DOM entries and native keyboard navigation.

`useInfiniteAgentResources` owns cursor requests, accumulated results, and revision recovery. Profile and chat supply separate query scopes and filters. Profile includes enabled and disabled resources; chat requests enabled skills and excludes built-in command names. `ResourceLoadMore` owns the Profile intersection observer and loading controls. API request construction remains in `api/agentResources.ts`.

## Existing HTTP endpoints

`GET /api/v1/agents/{id}/skill-summaries` and `GET /api/v1/agents/{id}/mcp-servers` preserve their existing complete responses when `pagination` is omitted. MCP editing and candidate membership checks continue to use complete configuration. The skill installation dialog loads complete membership only when opened.

With `pagination=page`, parameters are `page` (default 1), `per` (default 20, maximum 100), optional `search`, `enabled`, and `list_revision`. Responses contain `items`, `page`, `per`, `total`, `list_revision`, and `has_more`. MCP items contain `name` and `config`; skill items retain their existing fields. Both response modes provide the Agent ETag used by enablement mutations.

With `pagination=cursor`, parameters are `limit` (default 20, maximum 100), optional `cursor`, `search`, `enabled`, and repeated `exclude`. Responses contain `items`, `total`, `list_revision`, `next_cursor` when more results exist, and `has_more`. Page and cursor parameters cannot be mixed. Invalid requests return `invalid_resource_query` with HTTP 400.

Filtering precedes deterministic ascending resource-name ordering and selection. Search uses case-insensitive name subsequence matching. The revision identifies the matching resource membership and query scope, independently of descriptions and MCP configuration contents. A mismatched revision or cursor returns `resource_list_changed` with HTTP 409. Both Profile and chat restart the cursor sequence. Descriptions and configuration always reflect the current query, rather than a historical snapshot.

`internal/resourcequery` owns filtering, ordering, range selection, and cursor validation. HTTP handlers own query parsing and response envelopes. Skill queries go through Agent Engine and WorkspaceService; the local skill reader enumerates valid membership before reading metadata only for selected entries. Directory enumeration remains proportional to the total number of skills. MCP configuration remains a complete stored map; pagination bounds its response and source status requests for loaded entries.

## Chat selection

The main composer, thread composer, and floating chat use the same infinite-query hook and picker. Opening the picker loads enabled skills in batches of 20. Search is debounced, sent to the backend, and replaces the previous cursor sequence. A sentinel near the bottom loads another batch. Keyboard navigation loads the next batch at the last skill, before entering suggested commands. Suggested-command selection survives appended skills.

The picker renders a bounded window of rows. Loading another batch keeps existing options available; failures expose a retry action. Built-in command names are shared with the controller and excluded by the backend before pagination.

Complete, Profile, and chat queries have distinct cache keys under each Agent resource prefix. Existing add, delete, and enablement invalidations refresh all active views. Source synchronization also refreshes infinite MCP queries. Complete MCP draft serialization remains independent of loaded batches.
